        <p>Found in the Iranian mountains in 1942, Corporal Wojtek was an essential member of the 22nd Transport Companyâ€™s Artillery Division in the Polish 2nd Corps in the Second World War. He helped boost morale in times of desperate need, most notably in the Battle of Monte Cassino against the Axis forces in 1944. He assisted on the front lines in the battle, by carrying ammunition for his fellow soldiers. Corporal Wojtek was also deployed to Egypt and the Middle East, where he further assisted his colleagues after grenade practice, by chasing after oranges they had used. By the end of the war, Wojtek was a celebrated war hero, with insignia of the regiment changed to dedicate him, and statues erected to honour his successes.</p>
        <p>During his deployment, Wojtek was raised drinking condensed milk out of an old vodka bottle, and enjoyed smoking and eating cigarettes. However after the war, Wojtek involuntarily retired from his post as Corporal and was sent to the Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland, where he called home until his death in 1963, which was partly due to problems in his esophagus. He died at the average age of 21, because he was a bear.</p>
